# The NPC Library

The NPC Library is a website where anyone who plays tabletop roleplaying games, creates stories or indeed runs games of LARP can 
come and create NPC's (Otherwise known as Non Player Characters) and store those created NPC's on the website for ease of finding them 
later rather than having to rely on paper notes or one of the other world building websites that can sometimes seem to offer too much.

The Live application for the NPC Library can be found here:

https://lydia-npc-library.onrender.com

# Purpose and Target Audience
### Purpose
The purpose of the NPC Library is to provide a place for Game Masters and other organisers/writers to have a place to store their created Non-Player Characters on a concise site that does not contain anything apart from the list of NPC's. Users will be able to add entry's that will allow them to keep track of their created NPC's with a name, genre, description and role.
### Target Audience
The Target audience for the NPC Library is anyone who wants to keep track of various characters, be they NPC's or other characters who may feature in works of fiction. I hope that this website will be of value to aspiring Game Masters and allow paper notes to become a thing of the past.
# Persona and User Stories
* As an admin I want to be able to delete entry's that are either inappropriate or not in use anymore.
* As a user I want to be able to edit my entry's to update them and also delete them if they become become no longer relevant.
* I want to be able to create an account so I can access the website and not have my entry's available to everyone.
* I want to be able to keep a list of NPC's for my use that I can look at with a glance.
* Add the ability to put a longer description in about each NPC.
* Add the ability to log into the NPC Library.
* Add a section about writing advice for both creating NPC's and wider writing.

# Agile
For this project I used the agile development method, this was not something I had done before as a solo developer so I took some time at the start of the project to try to go through and do everything properly from the start.I found by creating the Kanban board and user stroies I was able to priorotise and guide myself to fulfil the project criteria. I was able to reduce the normal amount of anxiety and stress I feel when working to a tight dealine by staying focused on one objective at a time.

# Aesthetic Choices
The colours for the website were picked to give a clean and functional look without distracting bright colours. I tried to have the colour go from lighter to darker as it went down the page.

Header - #014181
Text - #ffffff
Footer - #014181
Footer Secondary Colour - #495057 / #2c3033
Fonts - Arial 

## Features

### Log In
The log in page allows anyone who wants to use the website to sign up or log in with a previously created account. 
### Homepage
A user must make an acount with the website before they are allowed to reach the homepage, I made this so anyone interested in the website would have the oppotunity to create entry's for their own use.

### About page

### Writing Advice

### NPC Guests

The NPC guests page is where users can add new NPC's as well as edit and delte their own entry's. This entry will then be visible on the NPC guest page.

# Future Plans
In the future I would like to add the following:
* Add a searchbar to make it easier to find specific NPC's.
* Add tags to each entry so they can be marked as Side Quests, Antagonists and Main plot specific NPC's.
* A central list of NPC's anyone can contribute to and can be moderated.
* A way to form a community, perhaps adding a socail media presence.
* Add a way to make comments on their entry's to mark important events.
* Add a linknig system so one NPC can link to another.

### Database Design
![Database Design](static/images/Lucid-App-final-project-database-network.PNG)

I created the Entity Relationship Diagram to help me visaulise how my tables relate to each other, Lucidchart proved a helpful tool in doing so.

### NPC Library Flowchart
![NPC Library Flowchat](static/images/Lucid-app-final-project-flowchart.PNG)

I found the flowchat helpful in visualising what parts of the website needed to be completed in what order as well as tracking down where in the website changes I made might have run into issues.
