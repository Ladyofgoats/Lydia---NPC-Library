# The NPC Library

The NPC Library is a website where anyone who plays tabletop roleplaying games, creates stories or indeed runs games of LARP can 
come and create NPC's (Otherwise known as Non Player Characters) and store those created NPC's on the website for ease of finding them 
later rather than having to rely on paper notes or one of the other world building websites that can sometimes seem to offer too much.

The Live application for the NPC Library can be found here:

# Purpose and Target Audience
### Purpose
The purpose of the NPC Library is to provide a place for Game Masters and other organisers/writers to have a place to store their created Non-Player Characters on a concise site that does not contain anything apart from the list of NPC's. Users will be able to add entry's that will allow them to keep track of their created NPC's with a name, genre, description and role.
### Target Audience
The Target audience for the NPC Library is anyone who wants to keep track of various characters, be they NPC's or other characters who may feature in works of fiction. I hope that this website will be of value to aspiring Game Masters and allow paper notes to become a thing of the past.
# Persona and User Stories
* As an admin I want to be able to delete entry's that are either inappropriate or not in use anymore.
* As a user I want to be able to edit my entry's to update them and also delete them if they become become no longer relevant.
* I want to be able to create an account so I can access the website and not have my entry's available to everyone.
* I want to be able to keep a list of NPC's for my use that I can look at with a glance.
* Add the ability to put a longer description in about each NPC.
* Add the ability to log into the NPC Library.
* Add a section about writing advice for both creating NPC's and wider writing.

# Agile
For this project I used the agile development method, this was not something I had done before as a solo developer so I took some time at the start of the project to try to go through and do everything properly from the start.I found by creating the Kanban board and user stroies I was able to priorotise and guide myself to fulfil the project criteria. I was able to reduce the normal amoun tof anxiety and stress I feel when working to a tight dealine by staying focused on one objective at a time.
